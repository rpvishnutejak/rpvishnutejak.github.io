						<b> More up-to-date information can be found at the website of <a href="https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/About-GMU" target="_blank">dynaroars Lab</a> led by Prof. ThanhVu Nguyen. </b>

					GMU is an R1 university (R1 universities are those that meet the highest benchmarks in research activity and expenditures as measured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education" target="_blank"> Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>), and <span class="text-danger"> the overall CS ranking is 30 according to <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2017/toyear/2022/index?all&us" target="_blank"> csrankings.org (2017-2022)</a></span>. The CS department is growing rapidly, and the number of faculty members has doubled in the past 4 years. <span class="text-danger">There are 78 faculty (21 term, 21 tenure-track, 36 tenured) and 179 PhD students in the department. </span>Students will have the opportunity to work with all of our faculty members on cutting-edge research problems, and there are lots of collaborations within our department. GMU is only miles away from Washington DC, and is also very close to Amazonâ€™s new headquarters, which offers plenty of intern and full-time opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					GMU is the largest public research university in Virginia, with an enrollment of over 38,000 students studying in over 200 degree programs. GMU is located in the city of Fairfax in Northern Virginia at the doorstep of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, with unmatched geographical access to a number of federal agencies and national laboratories. Northern Virginia is also home to one of the largest concentrations of high-tech firms in the nation, providing excellent opportunities for interaction with industry (e.g., Amazon is building its second headquarters in Northern Virginia). Fairfax is consistently rated as being among the best areas to live in the country, and the area is close to three of the top 30 airports in the USA with direct flights to many continents, such as Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conjunction with Amazonâ€™s decision to establish a second headquarters in Northern Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia announced a multi-year plan to invest in the growth of degree programs in computing, and GMU has committed to accelerate its plans to grow its capacity in computing and high-tech fields. Among the exciting initiatives being undertaken by the university are the launch of the Institute for Digital InnovAtion (IDIA), a university think tank and incubator to serve the digital economy, and the expansion of its Arlington Campus with a planned 400,000 square foot Digital InnovAtion Building. These initiatives reflect hundreds of millions of dollars in new investment by GMU that will rapidly elevate GMUâ€™s already leading national position in computing and related areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ph.D. students are fully funded as GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistantship) or GRA (Graduate Research Assistantship). GTAs are supported by the department for the first two years, and students are expected to find an advisor within that time frame. GRAs are supported by funding from individual faculty members who serve as their advisors. By contacting faculty members in advance, students have a higher chance to get GRA offers (if any of the faculty members agrees to do so), and GRAs can commit themselves to research shortly after they start their Ph.D. program.
